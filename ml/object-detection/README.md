# Object Detection with p5.js and ml5.js

This project is a simple web application that uses `p5.js` and `ml5.js` to perform real-time object detection on a webcam feed using the COCO-SSD model.

## How to Run

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2.  Allow the browser to access your webcam.
3.  The application will start detecting objects in the webcam feed and draw bounding boxes around them.

## Technologies Used

*   [p5.js](https://p5js.org/): A JavaScript library for creative coding.
*   [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/): A library that provides friendly access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser.
*   [COCO-SSD](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/coco-ssd): A pre-trained object detection model.
